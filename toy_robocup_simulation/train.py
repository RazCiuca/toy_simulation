This file contains the main logic loop that trains our neural network via Q-learning to learn to play our
simulated robocup environment

See https://www.deeplearningbook.org/ chapter 8 for optimisation algorithms we use for deep learning
and https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/optimization_tutorial.html for a good tutorial and
boilerplate code for a basic training loop
