Simulation VERSION 1.0
-------------------------------------------
- Essentially electrons controlled by optional accelerations
- The ball is an electron with a smaller radius
- No rotational control at all.
- add ball and robot friction
- add temporary "kick" corresponding to an additional repulsion of the ball for a few seconds
    - restrain



-------------------------------------------
Decision: code in C instead?

-------------------------------------------

We have our terrain of size L_x by L_y
n players on each team, playing K games simultaneously
how many variables? 2*(2n + 1) : 2n players plus the ball in 2 dimensions.
we need to compute the distances between all pairs of players.
what functionalities do we want eventually?
    all players repel if they get too close
    friction from ground

- For the moment

let X = [K, 2n+1, 2] be a tensor containing the location of all players for all games, we need a tensor containing the difference
between all elements of X for all games

X_p = X.unsqueeze(2).repeat(1, 1, 2n+1, 1)

X_dist = X_p - X_p.tranpose(1,2)

X_norms = X_dist.norm(dim=-1)
X_directions = X_dist/X_norms

The force potential could be something like c/(x-r) so that the balls repel at radius

dV(r)/dr =

d^2 x/dt^2 = F/m = SUM( -(1/m) dV(r)/dr * X_dist)
